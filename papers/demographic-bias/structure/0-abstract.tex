This paper examines the correlation between 41 objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics and Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) across 102 facial images, each modified using four steganography methods at nine encoding levels. As IQA metrics are widely used to approximate human perception, understanding their reliability in the context of facial image distortion is crucial for applications in biometrics, forensics, and secure communication.  Using Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, we rank IQA metrics and evaluate fusion approaches, including PCA, regression, and machine learning. Our analysis also explores demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and non-demographic (attractiveness) biases in MOS, highlighting significant perceptual variations across observer and subject groups.
