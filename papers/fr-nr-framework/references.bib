abstract = {Steganography is the art of concealing information in a cover media in such a way that the presence of the information is unknown. Digital image steganography accomplishes the potential for protected communication that is crucial in most of the applications nowadays. Steganography has several beneficial applications. It has been driven to the frontrunner of present security systems by the amazing development in computational power, the rise in security consciousness. The main challenge in proposing a steganographic technique is to maintain a suitable balance among higher embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and security that separate it from correlated systems like cryptography and watermarking. This article offers an extensive state-of-the-art review and analysis of some recent steganographic techniques. Furthermore, we have discussed popular steganography tools in detail. Challenges in the recent deep learning based steganographic techniques have been addressed. To explore the domain, the article concludes with mentioning some future research directions.}

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to },
