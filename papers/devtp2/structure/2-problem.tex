\section{Problem Statement}

The primary objective of this study is to implement, train, and comparatively evaluate three prominent generative model classes: GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models. We assess their effectiveness quantitatively by computing the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)~\cite{heusel2017gans}, a robust metric to measure the similarity between generated and real image distributions. Additionally, we discuss qualitative results to highlight each model's strengths and limitations. The ultimate goal is to identify an optimal generative framework capable of producing realistic and diverse synthetic blood cell images.
